# frc2022-cv

The computer vision part of the πρ techs FRC 2022 year.

Implementation:

- [WPIlibPi (also known as FRC-Vision but thats lame)](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/WPILibPi) on a Pi 4 B.
- We have two camera currently, the one that embeds into the board because I had it laying around, and some cheap $10 one on amazon that may spontaneously combust.
- We may add other cameras in the future.
- We are using python, because screw C++, and rust doesn't currently have the best opencv port...
